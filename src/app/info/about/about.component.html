  <h2>Information for Developers</h2>
  <p>CGSpace is built on <a href="https://www.dspace.org" title="DSpace homepage">DSpace</a>. It is interoperable with other repositories and supports content discovery and re-use through use of international Dublin Core Metadata standards as well as CGIAR-wide metadata standards.</p>
  <p>The repository's metadata is exposed through both the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) and a REST API interface. For more information see the <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC7x/DSpace+7.x+Documentation" title="DSpace wiki">DSpace documentation</a>.</p>
  <p>Please try to exercise restraint when using these resources. For example, it is a great help to us if your programmatic use of the server can respect our <a href="/robots.txt"><code>robots.txt</code></a>, specify a user agent for its requests. Also note that we have a public test server at dspace7test.ilri.org which is running a recent snapshot of the production CGSpace software and data — please use this if you're testing a new integration or harvesting process! Lastly, if you are using our data we would love to <a routerLink="/info/feedback">hear from you</a>.</p>
  <p>The CGSpace source code is managed on <a href="https://github.com/ilri/DSpace">GitHub</a>.</p>

  <h2>History and Evolution</h2>
  <p>A little history and some credits.</p>
  <p>CGSpace emerged from work by the <a href="https://www.ilri.org" title="ILRI homepage">International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI)</a> to make its products public in a state of the art repository. Starting in late 2009, ILRI set up a DSpace repository. Looking for ways to capture products of projects hosted by, but not belonging to ILRI, communities were set up for other initiatives, such as the CGIAR System-wide Livestock Program.</p>
  <p>In 2010 and 2011, the <a href="https://waterandfood.org" title="CGIAR Challenge Program on Water and Food homepage">CGIAR Challenge Program on Water and Food</a> and the <a href="https://ccafs.cgiar.org/" title="CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security homepage">CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security</a> joined this effort and agreed to work on a "co-tenant" application of a single DSpace.</p>
  <p>With technical assistance and training from <a href="https://www.atmire.com/">Atmire</a>, the collaboration has grown to include other centers and initiatives seeking to have such a repository while sharing costs and achieving synergies. Some of this work has been documented in a series of presentations and blogposts (<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/search?q=cgspace">Slideshare</a> and <a href="https://maarifa.ilri.org/category/cgspace">Maarifa</a>), in <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/10568/82764">this article</a>, and <a href="https://www.ilri.org/news/celebrating-open-access-cgspace">this ILRI news story</a> and <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/10568/125167">infographic</a>.</p>
