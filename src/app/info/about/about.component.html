  <h2>About CGSpace</h2>
  <p>CGSpace is a joint repository of several <a href="https://www.cgiar.org" title="CGIAR homepage">CGIAR</a> centers, research programs and partners' agricultural research outputs and knowledge products. It is a tool to archive, curate, disseminate and permanently preserve research outputs and information products. CGSpace is both a repository of open access content and a complete index of research outputs.</p>
  <p>The collaboration is built across different initiatives with partners contributing to the core technical costs and working together to expand access to their products.</p>
  <p>Note: Not all content is inside CGSpace; it links to much content on other platforms. All efforts have been made to provide high quality information. Links off the site are not the responsibility of CGSpace content partners and collaborators.</p>

  <h2>Information for Developers</h2>
  <p>CGSpace is built on <a href="https://www.dspace.org" title="DSpace homepage">DSpace</a>. It is interoperable with other repositories and supports content discovery and re-use through use of international Dublin Core Metadata standards as well as CGIAR-wide metadata standards.</p>
  <p>The repository's metadata is exposed through both the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) and a REST API interface — <code>/oai</code> and <code>/rest</code>, respectively. For more information see the <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC7x/DSpace+7.x+Documentation" title="DSpace wiki">DSpace documentation</a>.</p>
  <p>Please try to exercise restraint when using these resources. For example, it is a great help to us if your programmatic use of the server can respect our <a href="/robots.txt"><code>robots.txt</code></a>, specify a user agent for its requests, and reuse its <code>JSESSIONID</code> cookie. Also note that we have a public test server at dspacetest.cgiar.org which is running a recent snapshot of the production CGSpace software and data — please use this if you're testing a new integration or harvesting process! Lastly, if you are using our data we would love to <a routerLink="/info/feedback">hear from you</a>.</p>
  <p>The CGSpace source code is managed on <a href="https://github.com/ilri/DSpace">GitHub</a>.</p>
  <h2>History and Evolution</h2>
  <p>A little history and some credits.</p>
  <p>CGSpace emerged from work by the <a href="https://www.ilri.org" title="ILRI homepage">International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI)</a> to make its products public in a state of the art repository. Starting in late 2009, ILRI set up a DSpace repository. Looking for ways to capture products of projects hosted by, but not belonging to ILRI, communities were set up for other initiatives, such as the CGIAR System-wide Livestock Program.</p>
  <p>In 2010 and 2011, the <a href="https://waterandfood.org" title="CGIAR Challenge Program on Water and Food homepage">CGIAR Challenge Program on Water and Food</a> and the <a href="https://ccafs.cgiar.org/" title="CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security homepage">CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security</a> joined this effort and agreed to work on a "co-tenant" application of a single DSpace.</p>
  <p>With technical assistance and training from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.atmire.com/">Atmire</a>, the collaboration has grown to include other centers and initiatives seeking to have such a repository while sharing costs and achieving synergies. Some of this work has been documented in a series of presentations and blogposts (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/search/slideshow?searchfrom=header&amp;q=cgspace;">Slideshare</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://maarifa.ilri.org/category/cgspace">Maarifa</a>), in <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/10568/82764">this article</a>, and <a href="https://www.ilri.org/news/celebrating-open-access-cgspace">this ILRI news story</a> and <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/10568/125167">infographic</a>.</p>
